# Task 1: Memory Error (Valgrind)

---

## Error 1: Stack Return in `mistake1`

### Before Fix:
```
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

### Explanation:
```c
int buf[] = {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
return buf;
```
Returning a pointer to a stack array (`buf`) results in accessing invalid memory.

### Fix:
```c
int* buf = malloc(6 * sizeof(int));
for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) buf[i] = tmp[i];
return buf;
```

## Error 2: Invalid Malloc Size & Free in `mistake2`

### Before Fix:
```
== Invalid free()
== Address 0x... is 4 bytes inside a block of size 16 alloc'd
== definitely lost: 72 bytes in 4 blocks
```

### Explanation:
- `malloc(sizeof(char) * 4)` is too small for 4 integers.
- `free(p[1])` points to the middle of a block.

### Fix:
```c
int* buf = malloc(4 * sizeof(int));
free(p[1] - 1);
```

---

## Error 3: Use-After-Free and OOB in `mistake3`

### Before Fix:
```
Use of uninitialised value
Invalid write of size 4
```

### Explanation:
```c
buf[4] = 3;
free(buf);
return buf;
```
- Writes past allocated memory.
- Returns pointer after it has been freed.

### Fix:
```c
int* buf = malloc(4 * sizeof(int));
buf[2] = 3;
return buf;
```

---

## Error 4: Invalid Function Pointer Cast in `mistake4`

### Before Fix:
```
Segmentation fault
```

### Explanation:
```c
int* buf = (int*)&mistake2;
buf[0] = 4;
```
Function pointer cast to data pointer and modified â€” undefined behavior.

### Fix:
```c
int* buf = malloc(sizeof(int));
buf[0] = 4;
```
